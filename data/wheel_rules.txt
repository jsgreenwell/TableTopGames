The game is based on the Hangman, but I like Wheel of Fortune's name better :)
  A hint is given then you guess the letters of the word or guess the word.
  Points are set at number of letters * 20 and lower by a set amount each time.
  Difficulty levels include:
     Easy: Hint is shown each turn, letter guessed is displayed, simple phrases
     Normal: Hint is shown every 3 turns, no letter guessed displayed, normal phrases
     Hard: Hint shown once, no letter guessed displayed, hardest phrases
