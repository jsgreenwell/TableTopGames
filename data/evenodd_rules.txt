===========================================================================
Cho-Han, or Cho-Han Bakuchi, is a traditional gambling game in Japan.
The game is remarkably simple, using only two standard six-sided dice and a bamboo cup
for the dealer to roll the dice. The cup/bowl contains the dice and is placed face down,
hiding the results from everyone. Then, players place their bets on the floor, either
for "Cho" (Evens) or "Han" (Odds). The dealer removes the cup to reveal the dice and
the winners collect their payouts.
